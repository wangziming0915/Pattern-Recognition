# Pattern-Recognition Project
This project is based on OpenCV api.

# Getting Started
Check the **Pattern_Recognition.pdf** in folder.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: Python, OpenCV api  
  
This project uses OpenCV to reduce the noise in pictures and recognize the shapes. Performing a 3*3 Gaussian filter to remove noise and recognize shapes (circle, square, and triangle). Use Histogram to determine the value of thresholding, and apply the Otsuâ€™s thresholding algorithm. Use BFS for connectivity analysis and OpenCV api for pattern recognition.

# Lessons Learned:
How to embed api in python program, how to translate image into operative metrix with filters and curtain algorithms. And the thresholding theory in pattern recognition process.
